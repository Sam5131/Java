res array is taking input from reverse as the st.pop given the topmost element first.
For example: {1,2,2,3}
1. empty stack st is initialized.
2. if stack is empty -> push(arr[i])->push(1)
3. if stack.peek!=arr[i]-> push(arr[i])->push(2)
4. if arr[i] == st.peek()-> if(i==n-1 or arr[i]!=arr[i+1])-> pop(2)
5. if st.peek()!=arr[i]->push(3)
res: {1,3}
